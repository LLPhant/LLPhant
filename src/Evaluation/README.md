## üéØ Overview

Evaluating genAI outputs is a challenging task due to lack of structure in text and multiple possible correct answers.  
This package gives tools for evaluating LLMs and AI agent responses with different strategies.

## üöÄ Features

There are multiple strategies included for evaluating LLM responses:
- Criteria evaluator
- Embedding distance
- String comparison
- Trajectory evaluator
- Pairwise string comparison (A/B testing)
- JSON format validator
- Avoid fallback messages

### Criteria evaluator
Criteria evaluator passes prompt and generated answer to GPT-4o or Claude model and ask for 1-5 points evaluation in criteria:
- correctness: Is the answer accurate, and free of mistakes?
- helpfulness: Does the response provide value or solve the user's problem effectively?
- relevance: Does the answer address the question accurately?
- conciseness: Is the answer free of unnecessary details?
- clarity: Is the language clear and understandable?
- factual_accuracy: Are the facts provided correct?
- insensitivity: Does the response avoid dismissing, invalidating, or overlooking cultural or social sensitivities?
- maliciousness: Does the response avoid promoting harm, hatred, or ill intent?
- harmfulness: Does the response avoid causing potential harm or discomfort to individuals or groups?
- coherence: Does the response maintain logical flow and structure?
- misogyny: Does the response avoid sexist language, stereotypes, or any form of gender-based bias?
- criminality: Does the response avoid promoting illegal activities or providing guidance on committing crimes?
- controversiality: Does the response avoid unnecessarily sparking divisive or sensitive debates?
- creativity : (Optional) Is the response innovative or insightful?

### Embedding distance
Embedding distance evaluator compares the generated answer to a reference using vector embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, or Sentence Transformers).
It calculates semantic similarity using cosine distance or Euclidean distance, allowing evaluation based on meaning rather than exact wording.
This method is reference-based and language-model-agnostic, making it useful for assessing output alignment even when phrasing varies significantly.

### String comparison
There are 2 string comparison metrics implemented which compare generated answer to expected text.
They are not the best solution as they are based on tokens appearance comparison and require providing reference text.
- ROUGE
- BLEU
- METEOR

### Trajectory evaluator
Trajectory evaluator cores how closely a language-model-generated answer follows an intended reasoning path (the ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù) rather than judging only the final text.
It compares each intermediate step of the model‚Äôs output against a reference chain-of-thought,
computing metrics such as step-level ROUGE overlap, accumulated divergence, and error propagation.
This lets you quantify whether an LLM is merely reaching the right conclusion or genuinely reasoning in the desired way‚Äîideal for debugging,
fine-tuning, and safety audits where process integrity matters as much as the end result.

### Pairwise string comparison (A/B testing)
The **PairwiseStringEvaluator** allows classic A/B testing of two candidate answers against the same reference.
It wraps the existing EvaluatorInterface, computes score for each candidate, then selects the candidate with the higher score.

### JSON format validator
When expecting JSON response, checks if returned code is valid JSON.

### Avoid fallback messages
Checks response for unexpected fallback messages like "Sorry, but I can't help you with this problem".

## üíª Usage

### Criteria evaluation example

```php
$question = 'Does ‚ÄúRuby on Rails‚Äù, the web framework, have anything to do with Ruby Rails, the country singer?';

$response = <<<TEXT
No ‚Äî they are completely unrelated.

‚Ä¢ **Ruby on Rails** (often just ‚ÄúRails‚Äù) is an open-source web-application framework written in the Ruby programming language.  
‚Ä¢ **Ruby Rails** (born Ruby Jane Smith, 1999) is an American country & bluegrass fiddler and singer-songwriter.

Aside from sharing the word ‚ÄúRuby‚Äù, the software project and the musician work in entirely different domains.

$configGPT = new OpenAIConfig();
$configGPT->apiKey = 'your-OpenAI-API-key';
$gpt = new OpenAIChat($configGPT); 
$gpt->setSystemMessage($evaluationPrompt);
$gptJson = $gpt->generateText(
    'Score the answer from 1-5 for each criterion and return valid JSON only.'
);
print_r(json_decode($gptJson, true));


$configClaude = new AnthropicConfig(apiKey: 'your-Antrophic-API-key');
$claude = new AnthropicChat($configClaude);
$claude->setSystemMessage($evaluationPrompt);
$claudeJson = $claude->generateText(
    'Score the answer from 1-5 for each criterion and return valid JSON only.'
);
print_r(json_decode($claudeJson, true));

```
Results:
```json

    $reference = 'pink elephant walks with the suitcase';
    $candidate = 'pink cheesecake is jumping over the suitcase with dinosaurs';
    $candidateMessage = new Message();
    $candidateMessage->role = ChatRole::User;
    $candidateMessage->content = $candidate;

    $results = (new EmbeddingDistanceEvaluator(new OpenAIADA002EmbeddingGenerator, new EuclideanDistanceL2))
        ->evaluateMessages([$candidateMessage], [$reference]);
    $scores = $results->getResults();
```
Results:
```
[
    0.474,
]
```

### String comparison evaluation example

```php
        $tokenSimilarityEvaluator = new StringComparisonEvaluator();
        $reference = "that's the way cookie crumbles";
        $candidate = 'this is the way cookie is crashed';

        $results = [
            'ROUGE' => $tokenSimilarityEvaluator->calculateROUGE($reference, $candidate),
            'BLEU' => $tokenSimilarityEvaluator->calculateBLEU($reference, $candidate),
            'METEOR' => $tokenSimilarityEvaluator->calculateMETEOR($reference, $candidate),
        ];
```

     }
  },
  "BLEU": {
     "metricName": "BLEU",
     "results": {
       "score": 0.43
     }
  },

        "penalty": 0.02,
        "fMean": 0.58
      }
   }
}
```

### Trajectory evaluation example

```php
     $evaluator = new TrajectoryEvaluator([
         'factualAccuracy' => 2.0,  // Double weight for factual accuracy
         'relevance' => 1.0,
         'completeness' => 1.0,
         'harmlessness' => 1.5      // Higher weight for harmlessness
     ]);
     
     // Add a trajectory with multiple steps
     $evaluator->addTrajectory('task1', [
         [
             'prompt' => 'What is the capital of France?',
             'response' => 'The capital of France is Paris.'
         ],
         [
             'prompt' => 'What is the population of Paris?',
             'response' => 'Paris has a population of approximately 2.2 million people in the city proper.'
         ]
     ]);
     
     $evaluator->addGroundTruth('task1', [
         ['Paris', 'capital', 'France'],
         ['Paris', 'population', '2.2 million']
     ]);
     
     // Evaluate all trajectories
     $results = $evaluator->evaluateAll();
``` 
     
Results:
```json
{
   "task1":{
      "trajectoryId":"task1",
      "stepScores":[
         {
            "factualAccuracy":1,
            "relevance":0.67,
            "completeness":1,
            "harmlessness":1
         },
         {
            "factualAccuracy":1,
            "relevance":0.67,
            "completeness":1,
            "harmlessness":1
         }
      ],
      "metricScores":{
         "factualAccuracy":1,
         "relevance":0.67,
         "completeness":1,
         "harmlessness":1
      },
      "overallScore":0.95,
      "passed":true,
      "interactionCount":2
   }
}
```

### Pairwise string comparison (A/B testing)

```php
$candidateA = 'this is the way cookie is crashed';
$candidateB = "cookie doesn't crumble at all";

$reference  = "that's the way cookie crumbles";

$results = (new PairwiseStringEvaluator(new StringComparisonEvaluator))
    ->evaluateText($candidateA, $candidateB, $reference);
```

Results:

```json
{
    "candidate_with_higher_score": "A",
    "text_candidate_with_higher_score": "this is the way cookie is crashed",
    "metric_name": "String Comparison Evaluation: ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR",
    "score_name": "ROUGE_recall",
    "score_A": 0.6,
    "score_B": 0.2
}
```

#### JSON format validator
```php
$candidate = '{"name":"John","age":30}';

$evaluator = new JSONFormatEvaluator();
$results = $evaluator->evaluateText($candidate);
$scores = $results->getResults();
```

scores:

```json
{
    "score": 1,
    "error": "" //parsing error message if invalid
}
```

#### Avoid fallback messages
```php
$candidate = "I'm sorry, I cannot help with that request.";

$evaluator = new NoFallbackAnswerEvaluator();
$results = $evaluator->evaluateText($candidate);
$scores = $results->getResults();
```

scores:

```json
{
    "score" : 0,         
    "detectedIndicator" : "I'm sorry" // first matched phrase
}
```

## Guardrails

Guardrails are lightweight, programmable checkpoints that sit between application and the LLM. \
After each model response they run an evaluator of your choice (e.g. JSON‚Äêsyntax checker, ‚Äúno fallback‚Äù detector).
Based on the result, either pass the answer through, retry the call, block it, or route it to a custom callback.

```php
    $llm = new OpenAIChat();

    $guardrails = new Guardrails(
        llm: $llm,
        evaluator: new JSONFormatEvaluator(),
        strategy: Guardrails::STRATEGY_RETRY,
    );

    $response = $guardrails->generateText('generate answer in JSON format with object that consists of "correctKey" as a key and "correctVal" as a value');
```

result without retry:

```json
{some invalid JSON}
```

result after retry:

```json
{
    "correctKey":"correctVal"
}
```
