# LLPhant - A comprehensive PHP Generative AI Framework

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc/assets/llphant-logo.png" alt="LLPhant" style="border-radius: 50%; padding-bottom: 20px"/>
</div>

We designed this framework to be as simple as possible, while still providing you with the tools you need to build powerful apps.
It is compatible with Symfony and Laravel.

For the moment only OpenAI is supported, if you want to use other LLMs, you can use [genossGPT](https://github.com/OpenGenenerativeAI/GenossGPT)
as a proxy.

We want to thank few amazing projects that we use here or inspired us:
- the learnings from using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [LLamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- the excellent work from the [OpenAI PHP SDK](https://github.com/openai-php/client).

## Get Started

> **Requires [PHP 8.1+](https://php.net/releases/)**

First, install LLPhant via the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager:

```bash
composer require theodo-group/llphant
```

You may also want to check the requirements for [OpenAI PHP SDK](https://github.com/openai-php/client) as it is the main client.

### Database

If you want to store some embeddings and perform a similarity search you will need a database.
One simple solution for web developers is to use a postgresql database **with the pgvector extension**.
You can find all the information on the pgvector extension on its [github repository](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

We suggest you 3 simple solutions to get a postgresql database with the extension enabled:
- use docker with the [docker-compose.yml](devx/docker-compose.yml) file
- use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- use [Neon](https://neon.tech/)

In any case you will need to activate the extension:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

Then you can create a table and store vectors.
This sql query will create the table from the example entity that we use later in [VectorStore](#VectorStores) section.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embeddings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR
);
```
## Use Case
There are plenty use cases for Generative AI and new ones are creating every day. Let's see the most common ones.
Based on a [survey from the MLOPS community](https://mlops.community/surveys/llm/) and [this survey from Mckinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year) 
the most common use case of AI are the following:
- Create semantic search that can find relevant information in a lot of data. Example: [Slite](https://slite.com/)
- Create chatbots / augmented FAQ that use semantic search and text summarization to answer customer questions. Example: [Quivr](https://www.quivr.app/) is using such similar technology.
- Create personalized content for your customers (product page, emails, messages,...). Example [Carrefour](https://www.carrefour.com/en/news/2023/carrefour-integrates-openai-technologies-and-launches-generative-ai-powered-shopping).
- Create a text summarizer that can summarize a long text into a short one.

Not widely spread yet but with increasing adoption:
- Create personal shopper for augmented ecommerce experience. Example: [Madeline](https://www.knxt-madeline.com/)
- Create AI agent to perform various task autonomously. Example: [AutoGpt](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)
- Create coding tool that can help you write or revie code. Example: [Code Review GPT](https://github.com/mattzcarey/code-review-gpt)

If you want to discover more usage from the community, you can see here a list of [GenAI Meetups](https://www.genaidays.org/events/).

## Usage
The most simple to allow the call to OpenAI is to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXX
```

You can also create an OpenAIConfig object and pass it to the constructor of the OpenAIChat or OpenAIEmbeddings.

```php
$config = new OpenAIConfig();
$config->apiKey = 'fakeapikey';
$chat = new OpenAIChat($config);
```

### Chat
> ðŸ’¡ This class can be used to generate content, to create a chatbot or to create a text summarizer.

The API to generate text using OpenAI will only be from the chat API.
So even if you want to generate a completion for a simple question under the hood it will use the chat API.
This is why this class is called OpenAIChat.
We can use it to simply generate text from a prompt.

This will ask directly an answer from the LLM.
```php
$chat = new OpenAIChat();
$response = $chat->generateText('what is one + one ?'); // will return something like "Two"
```

If you want to display in your frontend a stream of text like in ChatGPT you can use the following method.
```php
$chat = new OpenAIChat();
return $chat->generateStreamOfText('can you write me a poem of 10 lines about life ?');
```

You can add instruction so the LLM will behave in a specific manner.

```php
$chat = new OpenAIChat();
$chat->setSystemMessage('Whatever we ask you, you MUST answer "ok"');
$response = $chat->generateText('what is one + one ?'); // will return "ok"
```

### Function
This feature is amazing. 
OpenAI has refined its model to determine whether a function should be invoked. 
To utilize this, simply send a description of the function to OpenAI, either as a single prompt or within a broader conversation. 
In response, the model will provide the function name along with the parameter values, if it deems the function should be called.
One potential application is to ascertain if a user has additional queries during a support interaction.
Even more impressively, it can automate actions based on user inquiries.

We made it as simple as possible to use this feature.

Let's see an example of how to use it.
Imagine you have a class that send emails.
```php
class MailerExample
{
    /**
     * This function send an email
     */
    public function sendMail(string $subject, string $body, string $email): void
    {
        echo 'The email has been sent to '.$email.' with the subject '.$subject.' and the body '.$body.'.';
    }
}
```

You can create a FunctionInfo object that will describe your method to OpenAI.
Then you can add it to the OpenAIChat object.
If the response from OpenAI contains a function name and parameters, LLPhant will call the function.

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc/assets/function-flow.png" alt="Function flow" style="padding-bottom: 20px"/>
</div>

This PHP script will most likely call the sendMail method that we pass to OpenAI.

```php
$chat = new OpenAIChat();
// This helper will automatically gather information to describe the function
$functionInfo = FunctionBuilder::buildFunctionInfo(new MailerExample(), 'sendMail');
$chat->addFunction($function);
$chat->setSystemMessage('You are an AI that deliver information using the email system. 
When you have enough information to answer the question of the user you send a mail');
$chat->generateText('Who is Marie Curie in one line? My email is student@foo.com');
```

If you want to have more control about the description of your function, you can build it manually:

```php
$chat = new OpenAIChat();
$subject = new Parameter('subject', 'string', 'the subject of the mail');
$body = new Parameter('body', 'string', 'the body of the mail');
$email = new Parameter('email', 'string', 'the email address');

$function = new FunctionInfo(
    'sendMail',
    new MailerExample(),
    'send a mail',
    [$subject, $body, $email]
);

$chat->addFunction($function);
$chat->setSystemMessage('You are an AI that deliver information using the email system. When you have enough information to answer the question of the user you send a mail');
$chat->generateText('Who is Marie Curie in one line? My email is student@foo.com');
```

You can safely use the following types in the Parameter object: string, int, float, bool.
The array type is supported but still experimental.

### Embeddings
> ðŸ’¡ Embeddings are used to compare two texts and see how similar they are. This is the base of semantic search.
An embedding is a vector representation of a text that captures the meaning of the text.
It is a float array of 1536 elements for OpenAI.

To manipulate embeddings we use the `Document` class that contains the text and some metadata useful for the vector store.
The creation of an embedding follow the following flow:
<div align="center">
    <img src="doc/assets/embeddings-flow.png" alt="Embeddings flow" style="padding-bottom: 20px"/>
</div>

#### Read data
The first part of the flow is to read data from a source.
This can be a database, a csv file, a json file, a text file, a website, a pdf, a word document, an excel file, ...
The only requirement is that you can read the data and that you can extract the text from it.

For now we only support text files, pdf and docx but we plan to support other data type in the future.

You can use the `FileDataReader` class to read a file. It takes a path to a file or a directory as parameter.
The second parameter is the class name of the entity that will be used to store the embedding. 
The class needs to extend the `Document` class 
and even the `DoctrineEmbeddingEntityBase` class (that extends the `Document` class) if you want to use the Doctrine vector store.

```php
$filePath = __DIR__.'/PlacesTextFiles';
$reader = new TextFileDataReader($filePath, PlaceEntity::class);
$documents = $reader->getDocuments();
```

To create your own data reader you need to create a class that implements the `DataReader` interface.

#### Document Splitter
The embeddings models have a limit of string size that they can process.
To avoid this problem we split the document into smaller chunks.
The `DocumentSplitter` class is used to split the document into smaller chunks.

```php
$splittedDocuments = DocumentSplitter::splitDocuments($documents, 800);
```

#### Embedding Formatter
The `EmbeddingFormatter` is an optional step to format each chunk of text into a format with the most context.
Adding a header and links to other documents can help the LLM to understand the context of the text.

```php
$formattedDocuments = EmbeddingFormatter::formatEmbeddings($splittedDocuments);
```

#### Embedding Generator
This is the step where we generate the embedding for each chunk of text by calling the LLM.

You can embed the documents using the following code:
```php
$embeddingGenerator = new OpenAIEmbeddingGenerator();
$embededDocuments = $embeddingGenerator->embedDocuments($formattedDocuments);
```

You can also create a embedding from a text using the following code:
```php
$llm = new OpenAIEmbeddingGenerator();
$embedding = $llm->embedText('I love food');
//You can then use the embedding to perform a similarity search
```

#### VectorStores
Once you have embeddings you need to store them in a vector store.
The vector store is a database that can store vectors and perform a similarity search.
There are currently 4 vectorStore class:
- MemoryVectorStore stores the embeddings in the memory
- FileSystemVectorStore stores the embeddings in a file
- DoctrineVectorStore stores the embeddings in a postgresql database. (require doctrine/orm) 
- QdrantVectorStore stores the embeddings in a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) vectorStore. (require hkulekci/qdrant)


Example of usage with the `DoctrineVectorStore` class to store the embeddings in a database:

```php
$vectorStore = new DoctrineVectorStore($entityManager, PlaceEntity::class);
$vectorStore->addDocuments($embededDocuments);
```

Once you have done that you can perform a similarity search over your data.
You need to pass the embedding of the text you want to search and the number of results you want to get.

```php
$embedding = $embeddingGenerator->embedText('France the country');
/** @var PlaceEntity[] $result */
$result = $vectorStore->similaritySearch($embedding, 2);
```

To get full example you can have a look at [Doctrine integration tests files](https://github.com/theodo-group/LLPhant/blob/main/tests/Integration/Embeddings/VectorStores/Doctrine/DoctrineVectorStoreTest.php).

### Question Answering
A popular use case of LLM is to create a chatbot that can answer questions over your private data.
You can build one using LLPhant using the `QuestionAnswering` class.
It leverages the vector store to perform a similarity search to get the most relevant information and return the answer generated by OpenAI. 

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc/assets/qa-flow.png" alt="Question Answering flow" style="padding-bottom: 20px"/>
</div>

Here is one example using the `MemoryVectorStore`:
```php
$dataReader = new TextFileDataReader(__DIR__.'/private-data.txt');
$documents = $dataReader->getDocuments();

$splittedDocuments = DocumentSplitter::splitDocuments($documents, 500);

$embeddingGenerator = new OpenAIEmbeddingGenerator();
$embeddedDocuments = $embeddingGenerator->embedDocuments($splittedDocuments);

$memoryVectorStore = new MemoryVectorStore();
$memoryVectorStore->addDocuments($embeddedDocuments);


//Once the vectorStore is ready, you can then use the QuestionAnswering class to answer questions
$qa = new QuestionAnswering(
    $memoryVectorStore,
    $embeddingGenerator,
    new OpenAIChat()
);

$answer = $qa->answerQuestion('what is the secret of Alice?');
```

## FAQ
*Why use LLPhant and not directly the OpenAI PHP SDK ?*

The OpenAI PHP SDK is a great tool to interact with the OpenAI API.
LLphant will allow you to perform complex tasks like storing embeddings and perform a similarity search.
It also simplifies the usage of the OpenAI API by providing a much more simple API for everyday usage.
